# Retail Sales & Customer Segmentation Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## Introduction
This project analyzes multi-year retail sales and customer data using Excel dashboards. It uncovers trends in sales, customer engagement, product performance, delivery efficiency, and market segmentation to support business decisions.

## Problem Statement
The company faces challenges such as frequent delivery delays, low product conversion rates despite high views, and limited growth in corporate and regional markets. These issues affect customer satisfaction and overall sales.

## Key Insights
- Sales were generally steady, with a dip observed in early 2018.  
- Over 60,000 unique online visitors indicate strong customer engagement.  
- High product views but low sales highlight poor conversion rates.  
- Top-selling products and key customers present opportunities for promotions and loyalty programs.  
- Majority of sales come from consumers; corporate and home office segments have growth potential.  
- Delivery delays affect more than 54% of orders, pointing to logistics inefficiencies.

## Conclusion
Improving delivery performance, optimizing marketing strategies, and focusing on high-performing products can enhance sales and customer satisfaction. Continuous monitoring with dashboards enables effective data-driven decision-making.
